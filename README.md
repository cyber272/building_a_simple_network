# Building a Simple Network

## What?
This project involves setting up a basic network infrastructure for Hackers Poulette, a startup with ambitions to grow. The network will consist of three PCs connected via a switch, allowing communication between them and access to the internet.

## Why?
Establishing a scalable and functional network infrastructure is crucial for any business, especially a growing startup like Hackers Poulette. This project ensures that the company's current needs are met while also laying the foundation for future expansion.

## When?
Deadline: 16/03/2024

## How?
The network will be built using Cisco Packet Tracer, a simulation tool for network equipment. The configuration will involve assigning IP addresses to the PCs, setting up interconnectivity between them, and enabling internet access. 

## Who?
This challenge will be tackled solo.

## Pending Things to Do
- Design and configure the network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Document the configuration steps in a report.
- Publish the Packet Tracer file (.pka) on the GitHub repository.
- Update the README file with project details, instructions, and links.
- Publish the "live" version on the startup's Discord channel.
