<h1>Building a Simple Network</h1>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p>This project involves setting up a basic network infrastructure for Hackers Poulette, a startup with ambitions to grow. The network will consist of three PCs connected via a switch, allowing communication between them and access to the internet.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Establishing a scalable and functional network infrastructure is crucial for any business, especially a growing startup like Hackers Poulette. This project ensures that the company's current needs are met while also laying the foundation for future expansion.</p>

<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Deadline: 16/03/2024</p>

<h2>How?</h2>
<p>The network will be built using Cisco Packet Tracer, a simulation tool for network equipment. The configuration will involve assigning IP addresses to the PCs, setting up interconnectivity between them, and enabling internet access.</p>

<h2>Who?</h2>
<p>This challenge will be tackled solo.</p>

<h2>Pending Things to Do</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Design and configure the network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer.</li>
    <li>Document the configuration steps in a report.</li>
    <li>Publish the Packet Tracer file (.pka) on the GitHub repository.</li>
    <li>Update the README file with project details, instructions, and links.</li>
    <li>Publish the "live" version on the startup's Discord channel.</li>
